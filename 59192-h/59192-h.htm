<p>The Battle of Kings Mountain <i>on October 7, 1780,
was an overwhelming blow struck by American patriots against
British forces engaged in the relentless Southern Campaign of the
American Revolution. The military importance of this sharp engagement
was described in strong and realistic terms by Sir Henry Clinton,
then commander in chief of the British forces in North America. He
spoke of the battle as &ldquo;an Event which was immediately productive of
the worst Consequences to the King&rsquo;s affairs in South Carolina, and
unhappily proved the first Link of a Chain of Evils that followed each
other in regular Succession until they at last ended in the total loss of
America.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p class="tb">Kings Mountain was a surprising action that halted the triumphant
northward movement of Lord Cornwallis, British commander in
the South, who had undertaken to subdue that section in a final effort
to end the Revolution. Though far removed from the main course of
the Revolution, the hardy southern Appalachian frontiersmen rose
quickly to their own defense at Kings Mountain and brought unexpected
defeat to Cornwallis&rsquo; Tory invaders under Maj. Patrick Ferguson.
With this great patriot victory came an immediate turn of events
in the war in the South. Cornwallis abandoned his foothold in North
Carolina and withdrew to a defensive position in upper South Carolina
to await reinforcement. His northward march was thus delayed until
January 1781, giving patriot forces an opportunity to organize a new
offensive in the South. After Kings Mountain there also came a
sharp upturn of patriot spirit in the Southern Piedmont which completely
unnerved the Tory organization in the region. This renewed
patriot resistance led eventually to the American victory at Yorktown
in 1781. The engagement at Kings Mountain was not only a memorable
example of the individual valor of the American frontier fighter,
but also of the deadly effectiveness of his hunting rifle.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>The War in the South Begins</i></span></h2>
<p>At the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775 the struggle between
the American patriots and British forces was fought mainly in
the New England and Middle Atlantic colonies. The driving of the
royal governors from North and South Carolina soon revealed to the
British the importance of holding the southern provinces. Early in
1776 the British War Office sent a combined military and naval expedition
to the coast of the Carolinas in an effort to restore the King&rsquo;s
authority. Hopes of gaining a foothold in North Carolina were
quickly shattered. Patriot militia decisively defeated loyalists of the
Cape Fear area on February 27, at the Battle of Moores Creek Bridge.
Sir Henry Clinton, who had landed a small force near Wilmington,
withdrew from the State. Clinton, and the British fleet under Sir Peter
Parker, then undertook the conquest of Charleston, S. C. The successful
defense of Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island, at the entrance
to Charleston Harbor, closed with the brilliant American victory of
June 28. Thoroughly discouraged, the British expedition left the
South and the first attempt to conquer it ended in failure.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>The Southern Campaign</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1778 the British again turned to the South in their final major campaign
to end the American Revolution. Military failures in the North
during 1777-78 and a strong belief in southern loyalist strength encouraged
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
the British War Office to undertake a full-scale southern
invasion in the autumn of 1778. The American-French alliance following
the British defeat at Saratoga and the threat of French intervention
also made it urgent for the British to move southward. They
hoped to obtain food and recruits in the South and an effective base
from which to attack the remaining patriot armies in the East. A
British military and naval expedition was also to assemble in the
Chesapeake Bay area and from that point aid the British forces in
the South to crush patriot resistance. This time the British were
confident of success. They strongly doubted that the South, thinly
populated and torn by sectional strife between patriot and loyalist
groups, could unite and fight off the invader.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>Conquest of Georgia and South Carolina</i></span></h2>
<p>The ports of Savannah and Charleston were vitally needed to support
the new invasion and the British set out first to capture them. At the
direction of Sir Henry Clinton, the first British landing was made in
Georgia, and Savannah fell on December 29, 1778. By February
1779, Augusta and other key points in the State were captured, and
by summer the British dominated Georgia. Their first move against
Charleston ended in failure in June 1779, but they successfully forestalled
a combined French and American attempt to recapture
Savannah in the fall of that year.</p>

<p>The fortunes of war turned further against the southern patriots
in 1780. Returning to Charleston in the spring of 1780, Clinton
besieged the city with overwhelming numbers and forced the surrender
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
of Gen. Benjamin Lincoln&rsquo;s American garrison on May 12. The loss
of this large, well-equipped army was a marked disaster for the patriot
cause in the South and greatly strengthened the British position in
South Carolina. Soon Clinton could depart for New York by sea,
leaving Lord Cornwallis in command of a large British force which in
a few months quickly occupied fortified points in much of the State.</p>

</div>
<p>Believing South Carolina to be largely subdued, Cornwallis now
began a northward march for the purpose of invading and overrunning
North Carolina. His plans were upset temporarily by the
advance of a new American army under the command of Gen. Horatio
Gates, the patriot victor at Saratoga. Appointed by Congress to succeed
General Lincoln as American commander in the South, Gates
had reached North Carolina in July. Moving southward to capture
the important British post of Camden, S. C., he commanded an army
composed of veteran Delaware and Maryland continental troops and
raw Virginia and North Carolina militia. In a surprise meeting for
both forces near Camden on August 16, 1780, Gates&rsquo; tired
and disorganized
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
army was crushingly defeated by Cornwallis. The last
large organized American army in the South had been destroyed, and
the British, more than ever before, appeared to be invincible. Their
triumph at Camden opened the way for the resumption of Cornwallis&rsquo;
triumphant march and the invasion of North Carolina in September
1780.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>Whigs and Tories in 1780</i></span></h2>
<p>The British victories at Charleston and Camden in the summer of
1780 increased the bitter strife between the loyalists (Tories) and the
patriots (Whigs) in the South. Both groups had been active in partisan
warfare since the invasion of Georgia in 1778. Cornwallis&rsquo; march
through South Carolina greatly encouraged the Tories. Many of
them from the coastal and interior regions of the Carolinas now joined
him as active recruits. Overawed by British force, other inhabitants
of this area renewed their allegiance to the King or remained neutral
to escape damage to themselves and their property. To counteract the
Loyalist movement, daring partisan leaders including Francis Marion,
Thomas Sumter, and Andrew Pickens, now took the leadership in
strengthening Whig resistance. Desperate and unexpected assaults
by day and night upon the advancing British and their outposts quickly
began throughout the lowlands and upcountry. While Cornwallis
was gathering supporters by threats and force or by allowing only
Loyalists to trade, the Whigs remained steadfast in their devotion to
personal and political freedom. Soon the merciless nature of the Tory
attacks upon outlying Whig settlements and Whig guerrilla fighters
so disgusted the neutral citizens of the region that many of them
turned to the Whig cause.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the day-to-day combat between Whig and Tory
in the Carolinas is shown in a military report of the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The animosity between the Whigs and Tories of this State renders their
situation truly deplorable. There is not a day passes but there are more
or less who fall a sacrifice to this savage disposition. The Whigs seem
determined to extirpate the Tories and the Tories the Whigs. Some
thousands have fallen in this way in this quarter, and the evil rages
with more violence than ever. If a stop cannot be put to these massacres,
the country will be depopulated in a few months more, as neither Whig
nor Tory can live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The southern Whigs included among their numbers both rich and
poor. They were people who placed principle above personal gain.
They came, or were descended from people who had come, from
Western Europe to America to escape religious and civil persecution
and to find a new life where the dignity of the individual would be
respected.</p>

<p>Among these immigrants were numerous Scotch-Irish Presbyterians.
They had settled first in the eastern sections of Pennsylvania and
Virginia. Later, they migrated in considerable numbers to the interior
of the Carolinas and present-day eastern Tennessee. As they cleared
new land for settlement and established their churches, they enjoyed
for the first time complete religious and civil liberty. Moreover, they
believed in the family as the important unit in all human life and
patterned their lives accordingly. The invasion of the South now
threatened to destroy their democratic society. They also feared it
would lead to the loss of their hard-won individual liberty and force
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
them to give up their right to develop the frontier and its resources
as they wished.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>The British Threaten the Carolina Frontier</i></span></h2>
<p>When Cornwallis began his march from Charleston, Maj. Patrick
Ferguson had been detached to lead a smaller Loyalist force into the
western section of South Carolina. Ferguson was ordered to use the
settlement of Ninety-Six as a base from which to organize Tory
militia, subdue rebellious Whigs, and reestablish British civil government
in the upcountry. He was also to protect the western flank of
Cornwallis&rsquo; advancing army.</p>
<p>One important stronghold in the Carolinas remained undisturbed
by Cornwallis&rsquo; victories and the Tory raids in the summer of 1780.
This was the region of the foothills and ranges of the Appalachian
Mountains which stretched through northwestern South Carolina,
western North Carolina, and into the present eastern Tennessee. Here,
the independent mountain yeomen, largely of Scotch-Irish descent,
were establishing a new frontier and protecting their crude homes
from the nearer threat of the border Indians. Their free pioneer life
had existed without interference from the King&rsquo;s officials, and they
were little concerned with the main course of the war on the seaboard.
Rumors of Ferguson&rsquo;s activities in the upcountry brought forth a few
adventurous mountain men in the summer of 1780. After fighting
brief actions with Tories east of the mountains, however, these frontiersmen
retired. Victory by such border fighters at the Battle of
Musgrove&rsquo;s Mill, on August 18, 1780, caused some of the mountain
leaders to fear that Ferguson would soon attempt to avenge this defeat.</p>
<p>Ferguson did not immediately pursue the mountain men. With
the news of Cornwallis&rsquo; success at Camden, he had also received urgent
orders to search the upcountry for the patriots under Col. Thomas
Sumter. This plan was interrupted by news of Musgrove&rsquo;s Mill and
by orders calling Ferguson to a meeting in Camden with Cornwallis.
Here, he was informed of the British commander&rsquo;s determination to
invade North Carolina at Charlotte in September. Ferguson also
learned that his Provincial Corps of American Loyalists was to be
detailed from the post of Ninety-Six to join his Tory militia. Finally,
he was directed to move with his strengthened force through upper
South Carolina and across the North Carolina border, crushing the
remaining patriots and rousing the back-country Tories. His advance
was intended to protect the rear and western flank of Cornwallis&rsquo;
army which reached Charlotte on September 26.</p>
<p>On September 7 Ferguson pushed across the western North Carolina
border. At Gilbert Town (the present Rutherfordton), he issued his
famed threat to the back country which aroused the horde of mountain
men who eventually brought disaster upon him at Kings Mountain.
He expected at Gilbert Town to surprise some of the mountain
leaders who had retired there for safety after Musgrove&rsquo;s Mill. In
August, however, they had agreed to return to their homes across the
mountains and raise a volunteer army to resist Ferguson&rsquo;s advance.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Remaining at Gilbert Town during most of September, Ferguson
was a constant menace to the bordering region. From his headquarters,
early in the month, he tried to frighten the mountain leaders
into submission. To carry out this plan, Ferguson paroled Samuel
Phillips, a prisoner, and sent him into the mountains with a message
to Col. Isaac Shelby, who commanded the patriot militia of Sullivan
County, N. C. According to a well-known account, Ferguson, in this
message, solemnly warned Shelby and the other mountain people &ldquo;that
if they did not desist from their opposition to the British arms, he
would march his army over the mountains, hang their leaders, and lay
their country waste with fire and sword.&rdquo; He followed this threat
with action and pursued a patriot party to the slopes of the Blue Ridge
before returning on September 23 to his temporary base at Gilbert
Town.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>The Gathering of the Mountain Men</i></span></h2>
<p>At the headwaters of the Watauga, the Holston, and the Nolichucky
Rivers, in present-day eastern Tennessee, news of Ferguson&rsquo;s actions
was received with growing alarm by the back-country settlers. Their
freedom-loving leaders were spurred in their determination to gather
a volunteer force with all possible speed for a surprise attack that
would destroy the British invader. Meeting at Jonesboro, Shelby and
Col. John Sevier, head of the militia in Washington County, N. C.,
hurriedly adopted a plan for immediate action. They sent forth a final
appeal for volunteers, some of whom would remain behind to protect
the settlements from the Indians while the main force marched quickly
after Ferguson. Additional support was sought urgently from Col.
Charles McDowell and Col. Benjamin Cleveland, who commanded
other fighting men from the North Carolina border. Pleas for help
were also sent to the local militia leaders of adjoining Washington
County, Va. After consultation, it was agreed that Col. William
Campbell would bring a strong body of Virginia militia. All volunteers
were urged to gather by September 25 at Sycamore Shoals, on the
banks of the Watauga, near the present site of Elizabethton, Tenn.</p>
<p>On that date over 1,000 of the mountain men assembled at the
designated meeting place. In appearance, it was a rough but resourceful
looking gathering. Many of the fighters wore hunting shirts of
buckskin, breeches and gaiters of tan home-dyed cloth, and wide-brimmed
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
hats covering long hair tied in a queue. Each was equipped
with a knapsack, blanket, and long hunting rifle; most were mounted
on horses, but some were on foot. With some had come members of
their families and friends to see them off on their dangerous mission.
Notable among the militia units present was that of Col. William
Campbell which numbered 400 men. To reach Sycamore Shoals
many of his men had traveled almost as far as they would in the final
march to Kings Mountain.</p>
<p>The gathering was made memorable by the inspiring words of the
Reverend Samuel Doak, a pioneer Scotch-Irish clergyman of the
Watauga settlements. On the eve of their departure, he sought the
Lord&rsquo;s blessing upon these brave men. To inspire and prepare them
for the hardships they faced, he retold vividly the biblical story of the
rise of Gideon&rsquo;s people against Midianites and of the defeat of those
oppressors. At the close of his stirring sermon he urged the mountain
men to take as their battle cry: &ldquo;The sword of the Lord and of
Gideon!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>The March From Sycamore Shoals</i></span></h2>
<p>On the following day, September 26, the great adventure of the mountain
men began, and they left Sycamore Shoals on their march over
the mountains. Five days later, after covering about 90 miles, they
arrived at Quaker Meadows, on the Catawba River. The first part of
their route followed old hunting and Indian trails, difficult at times
for passage by either man or beast, and this proved to be the most
rugged portion of their march to Kings Mountain.</p>
<p>Nearing the crest of the mountains on September 27 in snow that
stood above their bootstraps, members of the expedition were alarmed
by the desertion of James Crawford and Samuel Chambers. Not only
were the patriots afraid that the deserters would warn Ferguson&rsquo;s
camp, but also that the traitors would alert the Tories of the region.
Despite fears of a possible ambush, the patriots crossed the Blue Ridge
Mountains safely on September 29. The two units, into which the
volunteer army was divided, passed, respectively, through Gillespie
Gap and what is believed to have been McKinney&rsquo;s Gap. Shortly
afterwards, they were reunited at Col. Charles McDowell&rsquo;s plantation,
at Quaker Meadows, near the present site of Morganton, N. C. Here
they rested during the evening of September 30.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Col. Charles McDowell rejoined the patriots on
September 28. Before the expedition left Sycamore Shoals, he had
undertaken to secure the support of North Carolina patriots living
east of the mountains. He brought cheering news on his return. He
reported to his colleagues, that, according to his latest information,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Ferguson was still at Gilbert Town. Of immediate interest was his
news that Col. Benjamin Cleveland and Maj. Joseph Winston were
rapidly approaching with 350 North Carolinians from Wilkes and
Surry Counties. He also reported rumors that South Carolina patriots
were gathering under the command of Col. James Williams.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Council Oak, near Morganton, N. C., under which the patriot leaders decided

</div>
<p>The arrival of Cleveland and Winston on September 30 and the
night of pleasant relaxation at the McDowell home raised the spirits
of the mountain men. The following day, October 1, they continued
their southward march to a gap of South Mountain near the headwaters
of Cane Creek. Here they camped during inclement weather
through October 2.</p>
<p>While the men rested, the leaders of the expedition met in an evening
council to review the progress of the march. First, measures were
adopted to correct disorders in the columns resulting from the weariness
of the march. More important, however, was the election of Col.
William Campbell to serve as temporary commander of the combined
volunteer units. In recognition of Col. Charles McDowell&rsquo;s seniority,
he was entrusted on October 1 with a mission to General Gates&rsquo; headquarters
to request a permanent commander. He was instructed to
ask for the assignment of either Gen. Daniel Morgan or Gen. William
Davidson of the American Continental Army. McDowell&rsquo;s regiment
was turned over to his brother, Maj. Joseph McDowell.</p>

<p>Unknown to the patriot expedition, Major Ferguson&rsquo;s army in the
meantime had hurriedly left Gilbert Town. Two messages that he
received made this withdrawal advisable. In the first, received September
25, Lt. Col. J. H. Cruger, commander of the British post at
Ninety-Six, requested Ferguson to intercept a band of Georgia patriots
under Col. Elijah Clarke. This group was reported to be moving
northward to join the main body of mountain men. In the second
message, English agents in the Watauga settlements furnished Ferguson
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
with the first warning of the rising of his formidable back-country
enemy.</p>
<p>Ferguson immediately sent couriers in all directions to enlist the
support of the Tories within the nearby region. Others were sent to
call back all Tories who had been temporarily furloughed. On September
27 he headed south in the direction of Ninety-Six, reaching
the Green River on September 30. There he received further information
concerning the movements of the mountain men from
Chambers and Crawford who had several days before deserted the
patriot army.</p>
<p>From this point Ferguson sent an urgent message to Cornwallis at
Charlotte calling for reinforcements. Ferguson also informed Cornwallis
of his intention to hasten toward Charlotte with the hope that
his pursuers would be deceived into the belief that Ninety-Six was the
destination of his retreat. This communication was received by Cornwallis
after the battle, too late to be of any help. A second message
sent to Colonel Cruger requesting 100 men, brought no better results&mdash;only
the terse reply that his garrison totaled but half that number.</p>
<p>The following morning Ferguson left the vicinity of the mountains
and marched his corps 12 miles to Denard&rsquo;s Ford of the Broad River.
Moving at 4 p. m. on October 2, Ferguson crossed the river, marched
4 miles, and lay all night in an armed camp. On October 3, he
hastened his march eastward toward Charlotte along a route to the
north of the main Broad River. Near Buffalo Creek, he camped at
the plantation of a loyalist named Tate. Here he rested his men
and awaited expected reinforcements and further information concerning
the movements of the patriots.</p>
<p>Ferguson was now becoming anxious about the safety of his army.
In another message to Cornwallis on October 5 from Tate&rsquo;s plantation,
which was 50 miles from Charlotte, he advised his commander:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am on my march towards you, by a road leading from Cherokee Ford,
north of Kings Mountain. Three or four hundred good soldiers, part
dragoons, would finish the business. &lceil;Something&rceil; must be done soon.
This is their last push in this quarter and they are extremely desolate
and &lceil;c&rceil;owed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>The Pursuit to Kings Mountain</i></span></h2>
<p>The American patriot force meanwhile had moved cautiously southward
down Cane Creek toward Gilbert Town on October 3. The
following day, they learned that Ferguson had withdrawn from the
town. At the time, he was miles away, camping at Tate&rsquo;s plantation.
Although the mountain men were disappointed that they could not
engage Ferguson at Gilbert Town, they did not permit this to dampen
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
their hopes. They now took up a relentless pursuit of his retreating
army.</p>
<p>By the evening of October 4 they had pushed farther southward and
camped near Denard&rsquo;s Ford on the Broad River. At this point they
temporarily lost Ferguson&rsquo;s trail. Continuing southward, however,
on October 5 they completed a march of 12 miles and rested that
night at Alexander&rsquo;s Ford on the Green River. On October 6 they
pressed forward another 21 miles to reach the Cowpens. This point
in South Carolina was so named because of the extensive cattle enclosures
owned there by Hiram Saunders, a wealthy Tory. Ferguson&rsquo;s
hope that the mountain men would be misled and continue southward
toward Ninety-Six was a false one. From the Cowpens, the route of
the frontier army was to be generally southeastward toward the Broad
River and then north and east to Kings Mountain.</p>
<p>Along their route to the Cowpens, the mountain men were favored
by good fortune. They received accurate information from patriot
supporters in the region regarding the country through which Ferguson&rsquo;s
corps had passed in its retreat toward Kings Mountain and
Charlotte. Their spirits were also spurred by Col. Edward Lacey, of
South Carolina, who visited the patriot camp on the Green River to
report that a large body of North and South Carolina militia was ready
to join the expedition at the Cowpens.</p>
<p>As early as September 23, Col. James Williams, of South Carolina,
with the permission of North Carolina patriot authorities, had issued
a call for patriot recruits from the border of both States. His appeal
was headed: &ldquo;A call to arms: Beef, bread, and potatoes,&rdquo; and resulted
in the assembling of 400 men. Included were the forces under local
militia leaders, such as William Hill, Edward Lacey, James Hawthorne,
Frederick Hambright, William Chronicle, and William Graham.
When on the afternoon of October 6, these forces were united
with Colonel Campbell&rsquo;s command at the Cowpens, the combined
volunteer army numbered approximately 1,790 men.</p>
<p>At the Cowpens the report of a patriot spy named Joseph Kerr that
Ferguson was only a few miles ahead in the vicinity of Kings Mountain,
confirmed earlier rumors of the British force&rsquo;s position. To overtake
Ferguson without delay, the leaders of the patriot expedition
chose from their various commands a select group of stalwart fighting
men, all mounted, who immediately rode ahead during the night of
October 6 towards Kings Mountain. The exact strength of this
advance party is not known, but it is certain to have exceeded 900 men.</p>
<p>By this time, Ferguson&rsquo;s army was already encamped upon the top
of King&rsquo;s Mountain. From Tate&rsquo;s plantation, his route on October 6
for 16 miles followed the old Cherokee Ferry Road between Buffalo
and Kings Creek. He crossed a branch of Kings Creek near
Whisnant&rsquo;s mill site and continued along the old Ridge Road to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
main branch of Kings Creek. Fording this creek, Ferguson bore off
in a northeastward direction toward what is known today as Hambright&rsquo;s
Gap. Later in the day, he led his force through this gap
toward the vital ridge of Kings Mountain, about three-quarters of a
mile beyond.</p>

left, and the original Chronicle marker in the background.</i> Sketched by Benson J.
Lossing during his visit to the area on January 8, 1849.</p>
</div>
<p>The decision to post his army on the top of this ridge represented
a change of his plan to push forward and join Cornwallis at Charlotte.
It was a decision hard to understand when it is realized how close he
was to the security of the main British army. It is generally believed,
however, that Ferguson made the decision deliberately and with the
definite intention of meeting the patriots in battle. That he felt secure
in this position is shown from his letter of October 6 to Cornwallis,
which stated: &ldquo;I arrived to day at Kings Mountain &amp; have taken a
post where I do not think I can be forced by a stronger enemy than that
against us.&rdquo; Ferguson was also known to be a vain man. Operating
with the largest independent command of his military career, it is
probable that he could not resist the temptation to seek for himself
the glory of still another victory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the picked group of mountain men rode through the
night toward their objective under the cover of a drizzling rain. To

keep the flint locks of their weapons dry, bags, blankets, or even hunting
shirts were wrapped around them. To add to their difficulties, a
number of Campbell&rsquo;s men lost their way in the darkness. By the
morning of October 7 they were rounded up and the progress of the
march was delayed very little.</p>
<p>The Americans approached the scene of the battle with great caution.
Their path was along the same route as that followed by Ferguson
on the preceding day. They passed near his campsite at Tate&rsquo;s plantation
where they expected to find a covering-force on the east bank of the
Broad River. To avoid possible discovery at this point, they crossed
the river at Cherokee Ford, 2&frac12; miles below. By the forenoon of
October 7 the men and their horses showed the effects of the tiring
overland march from the Cowpens. Despite the suggestion by a
number of the leaders that a halt be called, Colonel Shelby is reported
to have replied: &ldquo;I will not stop until night, if I follow Ferguson into
Cornwallis&rsquo; lines.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>It was not long before the patriots learned definitely that Ferguson
was but a few miles ahead, posted on Kings Mountain. Constantly
on the alert for Tories who could be expected to warn him of their
approach, they followed the Ridge Road past present-day Antioch
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Church. From this point they proceeded in a northerly direction to an
old colonial road leading from North Carolina to what is now York,
S. C. This road, which ran in a southeastward direction, led them over
Ponder&rsquo;s Branch and a tributary of Kings Creek to Hambright&rsquo;s Gap,
not far from the site of the coming battle.</p>
<p>Kings Mountain ridge, upon which the encounter soon occurred,
extends 600 yards in a northeasterly direction and forms but a small
part of the 16-mile Kings Mountain range. The summit of the ridge,
which was stony, stood about 60 feet above the surrounding country
and was 60 to 120 feet wide. One of its main disadvantages was that
the tree line stood almost to its top. This enabled an expert rifleman
to fire effectively from ample cover on either side of the ridge upon
individuals on its crest.</p>
<p>About a mile from the ridge the patriot leaders called a halt, the
horses were hitched, and final battle instructions given the men. They
were formed into 2 lines, each consisting of 2 columns, and were
ordered to proceed on foot. Each detachment was to take a preassigned
position at the base of the ridge to complete the encirclement of
Ferguson&rsquo;s corps. The right flank column was composed of detachments
under Major Winston, Colonel Sevier, and Major McDowell,
with Winston&rsquo;s force at the head of the column. The right and left
center columns were commanded respectively by Colonels Campbell
and Shelby. The left flank column included the forces of Major
Chronicle, Colonel Cleveland, and Colonel Williams, with Chronicle&rsquo;s
force at the head of the column. As the march on the ridge began,
Major Winston was detached with a number of men from Wilkes and
Surry Counties to make a long detour to the right. It is believed that
the purpose of Winston&rsquo;s assignment was to close quickly Ferguson&rsquo;s
most logical line of retreat from the ridge.</p>
<p>Facing the advancing frontiersmen, Ferguson had a force of 1,104
men. These included, in his Provincial Corps, some 100 Rangers who
had been selected from the King&rsquo;s American Rangers, the New
Jersey Volunteers, and the Loyal American Regiment. The remainder
of his force consisted of about 1,000 Tory militia. His officers
included Capt. Abraham de Peyster, second in command, and Lt.
Anthony Allaire, adjutant, both from New York. Dr. Uzal Johnson,
of New Jersey, was surgeon for the British force.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>The Battle of Kings Mountain</i></span></h2>
<p>After passing through Hambright&rsquo;s Gap, the frontier detachments
moved rapidly into their preassigned positions around the ridge.
Seeking cover in the wooded ravines, the patriots advanced, and Campbell
and McDowell hurriedly passed through the gap at the southwestern
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
end of the ridge. They took positions respectively on the
southeastern and eastern slopes. Sevier formed along the western
slope, while Shelby took position on the northwestern slope. Meanwhile,
the other patriot detachments were forming along the bottom
of the ravine leading around the northern and northeastern base of
the ridge.</p>
<p>Ferguson&rsquo;s main camp was near the northeastern end of the ridge,
but his picket line extended along the crest nearly to its southwestern
end. About 3 p. m., as the patriots began to encircle the ridge, Ferguson&rsquo;s
pickets sounded the alarm and engaged the advancing mountaineers
in a brief skirmish. Then, as they reached their positions,
Campbell and Shelby almost simultaneously opened the main attack.
From the crest the Tories and Provincials replied with a burst of
trained volley firing. But Campbell&rsquo;s and Shelby&rsquo;s men moved
steadily up the slope Indian fashion, from tree to rock. For 10 to 15
minutes they maintained their attack, while the other patriot detachments
moved into position around the ridge.</p>
<p>While the trained Tory force &ldquo;depended on their discipline, their
manhood, and the bayonet,&rdquo; the mountain men relied upon their
skill as marksmen. According to an eyewitness account of this phase
of the battle &ldquo;the mountain appeared volcanic; there flashed along its
summit and around its base, and up its sides, one long sulphurous
blaze.&rdquo; Ferguson believed steadfastly in the effectiveness of the bayonet
charge, but the terrain at Kings Mountain proved &ldquo;more assailable
by the rifle than defensible with the bayonet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two patriot commands neared Ferguson&rsquo;s lines, the Tories
charged and drove them down the slope at the point of the bayonet.
Though they had no bayonets, the patriots rallied at the foot, and the
unerring markmanship of their deadly Kentucky rifles forced their
pursuers to retire. Slowly following the retreating Tories and Provincials,
Campbell&rsquo;s and Shelby&rsquo;s men were again driven down the
rugged incline by the Tory bayonets. Taking cover behind trees and
rocks, the two patriot commands again forced the Tories to retreat
toward the crest.</p>
<p>Much of the volley firing of the Provincials and Tories, with their
muskets and a possible scattering of Ferguson breech-loading rifles,
was aimed too high. It passed harmlessly over the heads of the two
patriot detachments, which now pushed even higher toward the crest.
As the Tories began their third bayonet charge upon Campbell and
Shelby, they were suddenly attacked along the northern and eastern
slopes by the other patriot detachments. Moving to meet the patriot
attack from these quarters, the Tories allowed Campbell and Shelby
to gain and hold the southwestern summit.</p>
<p>Now completely surrounded, Ferguson&rsquo;s disorganized and rapidly
decreasing force was gradually pushed toward its campsite on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
northeastern end of the ridge. In this desperate situation, with attacks
and counterattacks raging on all sides, the piercing note of Ferguson&rsquo;s
silver whistle urging his forces on continued to be heard above the
shooting and shrill whoops of the mountaineers. Suddenly, Ferguson
attempted to cut through Cleveland&rsquo;s lines near the northeastern
crest, but was struck from his horse by at least eight balls fired by the
mountain sharpshooters. He died a few minutes later.</p>

Society.</p>
</div>
<p>Captain de Peyster assumed command and attempted to rally the
confused surviving Tories and Provincials, but his efforts were useless
and he ordered a surrender. During the bloody 1-hour engagement
that raged along the heavily wooded and rocky slopes, the mountaineers
gained a complete victory. They were veterans of countless frontier
clashes, even though untrained in formal warfare and, with a slight
loss of 28 killed and 62 wounded, had killed, wounded or captured
Ferguson&rsquo;s entire force.</p>
<p>Order and quiet were not immediately restored to the rugged battlefield.
A number of patriots continued to fire into the group of defenseless
Tories, because it was not known that a surrender had begun.
Others fired upon the Tories to avenge the merciless slaughter of Col.
Abraham Buford&rsquo;s patriot force by Col. Banastre Tarleton&rsquo;s British
raiders at the Waxhaws in South Carolina, on May 29, 1780.</p>
<p>While Dr. Uzal Johnson of Ferguson&rsquo;s corps tended the wounds of
patriots and Tories alike, others buried Ferguson&rsquo;s body and those of
the Tory dead on the battlefield. Of the patriots killed in the engagement,
only four&mdash;Maj. William Chronicle, Capt. John Mattocks,
William Rabb, and John Boyd&mdash;are buried there. They share a common
grave at the site of the Chronicle markers.</p>

<p>The patriots rested on the battleground overnight. On Sunday
morning, October 8, they started the homeward march. One week
later they reached Bickerstaff&rsquo;s plantation near Gilbert Town with their
prisoners. The frontiersmen had not dared delay their march, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
they feared Cornwallis would send Colonel Tarleton in pursuit to
avenge Ferguson&rsquo;s defeat. At Bickerstaff&rsquo;s, a court martial was held
and 30 Tories were condemned to death; of these, 9 were hanged and
the remainder spared. Since an investigation showed that these 9
Tories had robbed, pillaged, and committed more serious crimes, the
patriots believed they were justified in this action. They also wished
to retaliate for similar types of rude justice rendered so often in the
past by the British.</p>

</div>
<p>The patriot detachments reached Quaker Meadows on October 15
with the prisoners. From this point they were marched northward
toward Virginia; this was in accordance with the instructions of
October 12 from General Gates, the American commander in the
South. On October 26, Colonel Campbell entrusted Colonel Cleveland
with the safekeeping of the prisoners and, with Colonel Shelby, called
upon General Gates to determine the fate of the remaining Tories.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the volunteer army melted away. Most of its members
lost no time in returning to their home settlements. As the number
of troops guarding the prisoners declined, escape became easy. After
a long period of indecision, the remaining Tory prisoners were finally
moved to Hillsboro, N. C., and exchanged. The mighty army of
mountain men, whose very existence confounded Ferguson, now vanished
as quietly as it had gathered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>The Meaning of the Victory</i></span></h2>
<p>The lifting of the spirits of the patriots in the Carolinas and the renewal
of their will to resist the British invader were important and
immediate effects of Ferguson&rsquo;s defeat at Kings Mountain. News of
this decisive victory spread rapidly through the region, bringing out
stronger patriot militia forces in North Carolina and from nearby
Virginia. It also revived patriot guerrilla warfare in South Carolina.
Tories in the Carolinas became greatly discouraged and disorganized.
The British did not immediately sense the importance of this sharp
improvement in patriot morale and were inclined to discount the loss
of the relatively small Tory force under Ferguson. At the headquarters
of the British forces in New York it was even denied that the
battle had taken place.</p>
<p>The unexpected success of the patriots at Kings Mountain caused
a delay of almost 3 months in Cornwallis&rsquo; northward advance. This
was a serious loss of time which had a far-reaching effect upon his
campaign in 1781. The immediate turn of events in the war in the
South that came with the victory at Kings Mountain forced Cornwallis
to abandon his foothold at Charlotte, in the unfriendly territory
of North Carolina. Fearful that the patriots would try to regain
control of key posts in South Carolina, he retreated to Winnsboro,
in the upper part of that State. Here he took up a defensive position
during the first part of the winter of 1780-81 to await reinforcements
sent south by General Clinton. Although ill during most of this
period, Cornwallis attempted to regain the support of his former Tory
allies in the region and to plan a second invasion of North Carolina.</p>
<p>Patriot leaders took advantage of his enforced halt at Winnsboro
and organized a new offensive in the South. At Charlotte, early in
December 1780, Gen. Nathanael Greene replaced General Gates as
American commander in the South, with the resolve to &ldquo;recover this
country or die in the attempt.&rdquo; Greene divided his small, ill-equipped
army into two partisan forces and directed them to distract Cornwallis
by threatening Camden on his right and Ninety-six on his left. This
daring plan gave Greene the military initiative in the Carolinas during
1781.</p>
<p>It led to the notable patriot victory at the Cowpens, on January 17,
and was followed by the strategic American withdrawal across North
Carolina, which dissipated Cornwallis&rsquo; strength and strained his supply
line. On March 15 Cornwallis overtook Greene and forced him from
the field at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, but British losses were
so serious that Cornwallis retired to Wilmington, N. C., for rest and
new supplies. All of these actions were important links in the chain
of events after Kings Mountain which led Cornwallis along the road
to Yorktown. From Wilmington, Cornwallis undertook his dramatic
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
campaign in Virginia which ended with his surrender on October 19
to General Washington&rsquo;s victorious American and French forces at
the siege of Yorktown. The 6 years of war in the American Revolution
were over and American independence was assured.</p>

<p>The Kings Mountain expedition and engagement illustrate the
characteristic vigor of the untrained American colonial frontiersman
in rising to the threat of border invasion. These events are memorable
as examples of the personal valor and resourcefulness of the
American frontier fighter, particularly the Scotch-Irish, during the
Revolution. The battle is a stirring record of the mountain man&rsquo;s
unerring marksmanship. It was truly a hunting-rifle victory.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>Patriot Commanders at Kings Mountain</i></span></h2>
<p>The patriot leaders at the Battle of Kings Mountain were of Irish,
Scotch, Welsh, English, French, and German ancestry. Six militia
colonels and two militia majors, who were in command of the eight
detachments which surrounded the battle ridge, are selected for particular
mention. The list includes Isaac Shelby, John Sevier, and
William Campbell, without whom there would have been no expedition
to Kings Mountain. Others of importance in the list are
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
Benjamin Cleveland, Frederick Hambright, James Williams, Joseph
McDowell, and Joseph Winston.</p>
<p><i>Col. Benjamin Cleveland</i> was born May 26, 1738, near Bull Run
(later of Civil War fame), in Prince William County, Va. As he grew
to manhood, he received little if any education beyond the lessons
that a hazardous life on the frontier could teach. Later, when he
settled in Wilkes County, N. C., he is reputed to have been the equal,
if not the superior, of Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone as both hunter
and Indian fighter.</p>
<p>His life was filled with adventures all of which added to the respect
and admiration in which he was held by his friends. He despised
the Tories and often showed his ruthlessness toward them. At
Bickerstaff&rsquo;s plantation, he is believed to have been most responsible
for the hanging of 9 Tories after the Battle of Kings Mountain, and
on other occasions he also displayed his familiarity with the use of
the rope.</p>
<p>In later life, he served as a justice of Pendleton County Court, in
the region of the Tugaloo River, near the western border of South
Carolina. It has been reported by his associates, among them Gen.
Andrew Pickens, that he frequently dozed on the bench and it often
was necessary to awaken him when his snoring interfered with the
court proceedings.</p>
<p>With the passage of years, Cleveland is said to have attained the
impressive weight of 450 pounds. It was always a question, when he
came as an overnight guest, whether this would prove too much for
any bed in the house. His excessive weight became a source of considerable
embarrassment and was partly the cause of his developing
a case of dropsy, with which he suffered for a number of years before
his death.</p>
<p>In October 1806, when he was in his 69th year, Cleveland died at the
breakfast table. He was outlived by his wife, son, and two daughters.
They buried him in the family burial ground on his old plantation,
in the forks of the Tugaloo and Chauga Rivers.</p>
<p><i>Lt. Col. Frederick Hambright</i>, who came with his parents from
Germany to America at the age of 11, lived from 1727 to 1817. He
is believed to have received a sound education that fitted him well
for his activities in later life. About 1755 he moved from Lancaster
County, Pa., to Virginia where he married Sarah Hardin. In 1760,
he settled near the South Fork of the Catawba River in North Carolina.</p>
<p>As Hambright became immersed in the &ldquo;American melting pot,&rdquo;
he took part in battles against the Indians and the British. He served
also in the provincial congress of the State of North Carolina. The
value of his services was recognized by promotion to the rank of
lieutenant colonel of militia.</p>
<p>This was the rank he held in 1780 when he received such a severe
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
thigh wound in the action at Kings Mountain that he was forced to
resign his commission. Finally, on March 9, 1817, at the age of 90,
Hambright died on property he had purchased in later life in the
vicinity of Kings Mountain. He is buried in the old Shiloh Presbyterian
Church cemetery, not far from the present park boundary.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">

<p class="pcap"><i>Maj. Joseph Winston, commanding
patriots from Surry County, N. C.</i></p>
</div>
<p><i>Col. James Williams</i> was born in the late 1730&rsquo;s at the family home
in Hanover County, Va. Upon the death of both his parents, when he
was still quite young, he moved to Granville County, N. C., to live with
his brother John. The latter was an able jurist and helped James to
gain a little education.</p>
<p>In his thirties, James Williams moved to Laurens County, S. C.,
where he worked as a farmer, miller, and merchant. Here he was
chosen a delegate to the provincial congress of South Carolina and
later made a member of the local Committee of Safety just before the
outbreak of the Revolutionary War. As he pursued his several vocations,
he made a good living for his wife and eight children.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of war with England, Williams served ably in
many actions, including Brier Creek, Stone Ferry, Savannah, and
Musgrove&rsquo;s Mill. Williams has been compared, in soldierly qualities,
to &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson. He was the only one of the colonels in the
Battle of Kings Mountain who died from a wound received in that
action. He was in his early forties. An eminent American historian
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
paid him this tribute: &ldquo;A man of exalted character, of a career brief
but glorious.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The McDowell brothers</i>, Charles and Joseph, were representative of
the landed gentry of the piedmont section of North Carolina. Maj.
Joseph McDowell (February 15, 1756, to August 11, 1801) commanded
the troops of his brother at Kings Mountain. Joseph McDowell had
the further distinction of being among the men of Kings Mountain
who later helped win the brilliant American victory at the Cowpens.</p>
<p>Joseph McDowell&rsquo;s home was at the family plantation known as
&ldquo;Quaker Meadows.&rdquo; He grew up there and later served in many
Revolutionary War battles under the watchful eye of his older brother
Charles. After peace was made, he engaged actively in politics on
local and national levels.</p>
<p>While serving as a member of the North Carolina Conventions of
1788 and 1789, he opposed ratification of the proposed State constitution,
because it did not include a bill of rights. A few years later
(1797-99), as a member of Congress, he opposed passage of the Alien
and Sedition Acts. Because of his stand on these issues and others
he came to be recognized as one of the leaders of the Democratic
Republican Party in western North Carolina. &ldquo;Throughout his life,&rdquo;
according to a local historian, &ldquo;he was the idol of the western people
of North Carolina.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p><i>Maj. Joseph Winston</i> was from a distinguished family of Yorkshire,
England, a branch of which settled first in Wales. Later, this family
group migrated to Virginia. Joseph was born on June 17, 1746, one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
seven sons, all of whom served in the Revolutionary War. He received
a fair education for that day, which prepared him not only for years
of successful military service, but also for a postwar career in the State
Legislature and in Congress.</p>
<p>At the age of 17, he joined a company of rangers and took part in
an expedition against the Indians on the frontier. This was the beginning
of his military service which ended after the Battle of Guilford
Courthouse. In that engagement he answered Gen. Nathanael
Greene&rsquo;s call for troops by coming to his assistance with 100 riflemen.</p>
<p>Winston represented his district, first Surry County and then Stokes
County which was formed from it, in the State Senate for eight different
terms. On the national scene, he served in Congress from 1792
to 1793 and 1803 to 1807. As a presidential elector, he voted for
Thomas Jefferson in 1800 and James Madison in 1812.</p>
<p>Joseph Winston died on April 21, 1815. He was survived by his
wife and a number of children. Among them were triplet boys who
lived to become a major general, a judge, and a lieutenant governor.</p>
<p><i>Col. Isaac Shelby</i> was born December 11, 1750, near North Mountain,
Md. He was the son of Evan Shelby, who emigrated from Wales
to America in 1735. In 1771 the Shelby family moved to the Holston
country in Virginia. Here young Shelby acquired the elements of a
plain English education and spent much of his time fighting the
Indians and the British. Between 1775 and 1780, with rank first of
captain and then of major, he explored the wilds of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Shelby is said to have had a sturdy, well-proportioned build with
strongly-marked features, and to have been of florid complexion. He
had a good constitution that withstood the rigors of frontier life where
fatigue and privation were every-day occurrences. His bearing was
impressive, and, although he maintained a dignified reserve, he was
affable and possessed of a pleasing personality.</p>
<p>He married Susannah Hart on April 19, 1783, at Boonesborough, Ky.
The young couple settled on land Shelby had staked out for himself in
1782, when he was a commissioner to adjust pre-emption claims on
the Cumberland River. Eleven children were born of their marriage.</p>
<p>Shelby devoted tireless energy to the creation of the New State of Kentucky.
With the adoption in 1792 of a State constitution by the convention
of which he was a member, his efforts were rewarded. Shortly
after, he became the first governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>After Shelby left the governor&rsquo;s mansion, he performed several other
public services. Among the most important of these was his command
of 4,000 Kentucky volunteers in the American army of Gen. William
Henry Harrison, during the Canadian campaign in 1813. He was
stricken with paralysis in 1820 and died of apoplexy 6 years later.</p>
<p>Shelby&rsquo;s friend and associate <i>John Sevier</i> (whose name was anglicized
from Xavier), likewise was well suited to frontier life. Sevier,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
born to Valentine and Joana Goode Sevier on September 23, 1745, was
of Huguenot ancestry. The Sevier family lived in the Shenandoah
Valley of Virginia where they farmed and traded with the Indians.</p>
<p>Sevier received a haphazard education, but this was in keeping with
the times. It included schooling at Fredericksburg Academy and the
Staunton School. At 16 he left school to marry Sarah Hawkins.
About 7 months after her death in 1780, he married Catherine Sherrill,
the &ldquo;Bonny Kate&rdquo; in song and story of the Tennessee frontier.</p>
<p>Wherever this leader of varied training, great courage, and personal
magnetism went, he brought change. Moreover, from the day he
founded the town of New Market, Va., where he engaged in trade as
a merchant, innkeeper, and farmer, until his death September 24,
1815, his actions stirred controversy.</p>
<p>In December 1773, he moved with his family to the Holston River
settlements. Here he helped to create the short-lived &ldquo;State of
Franklin&rdquo; of which he became governor. After the &ldquo;state&rdquo; was dissolved
and the area fully reincorporated into North Carolina, his
enemies circulated an unfounded report that he had used it to further
his own fortunes. The report gained such wide acceptance that he
felt impelled to move far out on the frontier. His was a reputation
that was made and then damaged, but his fall from grace was only
temporary. He later took advantage of the movement to form the
State of Tennessee and, regaining his political influence, became its
first governor in 1796.</p>
<p>Among the more unhappy experiences of Sevier&rsquo;s later life was a
feud that developed between him and an ambitious young judge,
Andrew Jackson. Although Jackson brought charges of land frauds
against Sevier, the political career of the Kings Mountain hero, which
included three more terms as governor between 1803 and 1807, was not
damaged. These two strong men with conflicting ambitions never
reconciled their grievances. In the eyes of the electorate, Sevier&rsquo;s
record of 33 victories in 35 battles was deserving of high regard and he
was duly rewarded at the polls.</p>
<p>Sevier lived to be 70 years old and came to be known as &ldquo;Nolichucky
Jack.&rdquo; His adventurous spirit characterized him to the end. Even as
late as 1812, following the outbreak of America&rsquo;s second war with
England, he advocated bringing &ldquo;fire and sword&rdquo; to the Creek Indian
Country.</p>
<p>Colorful as were the other patriot leaders, <i>William Campbell</i> of
Virginia, who has been described as a man of commanding appearance,
was an equally imposing figure. He was born in 1745 in Augusta
County, Va., to Charles Campbell and the daughter of John Buchanan,
Sr., who fought in the Wars of Scotland. As William Campbell
reached maturity, he stood 6&frac12; feet tall, was amiable when not enraged,
and devoted to the cause of liberty.</p>

</div>
<p>William was an only son and received a good education from competent
teachers. When 22 years old, he moved with his mother and
four younger sisters to Fincastle County, Va. The family settled on
the fringe of the Holston country on land that had been purchased
before the death of his father. This family plantation came to be
known as &ldquo;Aspenvale&rdquo; and was near the present town of Abingdon,
Va.</p>
<p>Like Shelby and Sevier, Campbell was interested in both the military
and civil affairs of his community. Upon the outbreak of the War
for American Independence, he raised the first militia company in
southwestern Virginia to support this cause. In September 1775, Capt.
William Campbell and his company of frontiersmen marched to
Williamsburg and joined the Virginia regiment commanded by
Patrick Henry.</p>
<p>When Campbell realized the British were trying to persuade the
Cherokee Indians to attack the frontier settlements, he feared for the
safety of his mother and sisters. Disappointed in his hope of resigning
his commission and returning home for their protection, he did find
happiness at the time by winning Elizabeth Henry, a sister of Patrick
Henry, for his wife.</p>
<p>In 1777, Washington County was formed from Fincastle and
Campbell made lieutenant colonel of militia. He was promoted to
the full rank of colonel in April 1780; this was the rank he held at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
Battle of Kings Mountain. For his services there he received praise
from Gates, Washington, the Virginia Legislature, and the Continental
Congress. Virginia presented him with a horse, saddle, and sword at
public expense. Lord Cornwallis, with oblique recognition of Campbell&rsquo;s
prowess as a foe, threatened him with instant death should he
be captured by the British.</p>
<p>Before Campbell finally resigned his commission, on March 20,
1781, he and his command, a small force of riflemen, fought well at
the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. He then enjoyed a brief term of
office as a member of the House of Delegates from Washington
County. Within a short time, however, he was recalled to duty, this
time to serve under General Lafayette in Virginia. His military
services were considered indispensable and the war was not yet won.</p>
<p>William Campbell&rsquo;s final service to his country was brief for, on
August 22, 1781, while on active duty, he died after a short illness.
He was buried at Rocky Mills, Hanover County, Va. There his body
remained until 1823, when it was removed to &ldquo;Aspenvale&rdquo; for interment
in the family burial ground. He was survived by a daughter
and his wife, who remarried and lived until 1825.</p>
<p>Such were some of the leaders in the drama&mdash;successful and honored
in peace as in war. It is doubtful that any of them, however, reached
greater heights than during that action, one October day, on the
slopes of Kings Mountain.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>Maj. Patrick Ferguson</i></span></h2>
<p>On June 4, 1744, Patrick Ferguson was born to Judge and Ann E. Murray
Ferguson at Pitfour, the family estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.
Patrick was one of a family of six children in which he had an older
and younger brother and three sisters. Ferguson&rsquo;s father, Lord Pitfour,
the Second Laird, had restored the family fortune lost by the
First Laird of Pitfour as a result of unfortunate speculation in the
South Sea Company. His children did not lack for the comforts
normally enjoyed by the offspring of gentry. They were fortunately
endowed also with a family background of learning and culture.</p>
<p>With this background, it is not surprising that young Patrick&rsquo;s
education was started at an early age. Any hopes or expectations
that his parents may have had, however, of developing him as a scholar
were short lived. After finishing the little schooling he received at
a military academy in London, Ferguson decided to use his ability
as a horseman and hunter and to become a soldier.</p>
<p>At the age of 15 a commission was purchased for him, and he entered
upon active service on July 12, 1759, as a cornet in the Royal North
British Dragoons. With a slight frame, Ferguson was not an individual
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
of commanding appearance, and it might have been thought
that he was poorly suited to military service. This shortcoming was
made up in soldierly determination, and he was also blessed by inheritance
with a serious disposition, unusual ability, sound judgment,
and energy in ample measure.</p>
<p>From the plains of Flanders and Germany to the spur of the Kings
Mountain range, where he was killed, Ferguson demonstrated his
soldierly qualities. For example, on June 30, 1760, he displayed his
characteristic contempt for danger at the Battle of Minden. In this
action he returned in the face of enemy hussars to retrieve a pistol
which dropped from his holster as his horse jumped a ditch. Such an
action was to be expected of him, if he was to be worthy of his name,
which was derived from the Gaelic &ldquo;Feargachus,&rdquo; meaning one of a
bold, haughty, and fiery disposition.</p>
<p>It was difficult for his mother to watch Ferguson embark on a military
career at such an early age. On August 14, 1762, her brother,
Maj. Gen. James Murray, wrote her from Quebec: &ldquo;You must no
longer look upon him as your son. He is the son of Mars and will be
unworthy of his father if he does not give proofs of contempt of pain
and danger.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Sickness interrupted Ferguson&rsquo;s service in the field from 1762 to
1768. He was not idle during the period of his recovery in Scotland
and entered actively into public discussion of the extension of the
militia laws of England to Scotland. This activity gave him some
early insight into the problem and prepared him for the role he later
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
played in the Carolinas as Inspector of Militia. He enjoyed a second
leave of absence from military service just prior to the outbreak of the
Revolutionary War. In this period he pursued an intensive study of
military science and tactics and developed the Ferguson rifle.</p>
<p>In 1777 Ferguson was sent to America with the reputation of being
one of the best, if not the best, marksmen in the British army. At the
time he held a captaincy, which was attained on September 1, 1768.
He was in command of a corps of at least 100 riflemen, whom he had
personally trained in the use of his new breechloading rifle. During
the earlier years of his service in America, Ferguson participated in
numerous actions in the North. Among these was the Battle of
Brandywine on September 11, 1777, in which he was so severely
wounded in the right arm that its usefulness was impaired during the
remainder of his life.</p>
<p>Ferguson was inured by years of service to such hardships. His
loyalty was rewarded on October 25, 1779, when he was promoted to
the rank of major. A few months later, at the start of the British
expedition against Charleston, he was given the temporary rank of
lieutenant colonel. His ability and personal magnetism enabled him
to win the respect of all his associates, and his success as an officer was
as notable in the South as it had previously been in the North.</p>
<p>This was his last campaign, and, in its course, he demonstrated a
sense of fairness and a degree of humanity that earned him the respect
of many of the people of the South. As the opportunity permitted,
he attempted to persuade many of these Americans to renew their
oath of allegiance to the King of England. His success won the admiration
of his associates, among whom was General Stuart of Garth,
who wrote upon the demise of this soldier: &ldquo;By zeal, animation, and
a liberal spirit, he gained the confidence of the mass of people....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even more revealing of his character are the following lines written
from America by Ferguson to his mother to calm her fears for his
safety: &ldquo;The length of our lives is not at our command, however much
the manner of them may be. If our Creator enable us to act the part
of honour, and to conduct ourselves with spirit, probity, and humanity,
the change to another world whether now or fifty years hence, will not
be for the worse.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>The Ferguson Rifle</i></span></h2>
<p>Great as Maj. Patrick Ferguson&rsquo;s success was as a soldier, probably his
most outstanding achievement was the development of the first breech-loading
rifle to be used by troops in battle. This arm, which is known
as the Ferguson rifle, was expected by its inventor to bring revolutionary
changes to gunnery practices. In the patent, which was granted
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
by the British Patent Office on December 2, 1776, Ferguson describes
it as &ldquo;... an arm which unites expedition, safety, and facility in using
with the greatest certainty in execution, the two great dessiderata [sic]
of gunnery never before united.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This rifle corrected many inadequacies of earlier breechloaders. Its
center of interest was the screw-plug attached to the trigger guard which
passed directly through the breech of the barrel from the bottom to
the top. This plug had from 12 to 14 rapid twist threads so that with
one turn of the trigger guard the loading aperture in the top of the
barrel could be opened or closed. The single-screw thread on breech
plugs of earlier breechloaders made it necessary to rotate the trigger
guard three or four times to open or close the breech. The Ferguson
screw-plug had the further advantage of being so designed that it
never came completely out of its socket.</p>
<p>For years prior to its invention, gunsmiths had given thought to the
development of a rapid-firing rifle. Patrick Ferguson believed he had
invented such an arm; he hoped it would prove its effectiveness when
tried under battle conditions in the War for American Independence.</p>
<p>Firing tests of the new weapon were conducted in the summer of
1776 at the Blackheath and Woolwich Arsenals, in England. Because
of its remarkable performance, it was also demonstrated before the
King at Windsor. In the course of a series of tests, and with a high
degree of accuracy, Ferguson fired 6 shots per minute at a target 200
yards distant from a stationary position and 4 shots when advancing
at a 4-mile-an-hour pace. He then wet the inside of the barrel, and
fired effectively after a minute to prove the worthiness of this weapon
in inclement weather.</p>
<p>Ferguson missed the target only three times during these tests, which
impressed most favorably the high army officers who witnessed them.
The tests proved that the Ferguson rifle was a weapon of infinitely
greater accuracy and rapidity of fire than the &ldquo;Brown Bess,&rdquo; the regulation
musket of the British army.</p>
<p>After Ferguson was granted the patent on his rifle, arrangements
were made for the manufacture of a limited number, probably 200
in all. The names of all the gunsmiths who produced this arm in
the last years of Ferguson&rsquo;s lifetime and for a short time thereafter
are not known with certainty. They were made, however, by Durs
Egg, Barbar of Newark, Barker of Birmingham, Innes of Edinburgh,
Newton, and Wilson of the Minories. In all likelihood, Durs Egg
completed the greater part of Ferguson&rsquo;s order for the new military
weapon with which to arm his rifle corps.</p>
<p>Three distinct types of rifle, depending upon the use intended for
the weapon, were made&mdash;those with the proportions of a musket for
the foot soldier, lighter models for the officers, and sporting arms.
There was a variation of 48 to 60 inches in the length of these weapons;
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
and a corresponding variation in the length of the barrels, which were
either octagonal or round in shape. Their bores ranged in size from
five-eights to three-quarters of an inch and were slightly larger than
the usual bore of the long American rifle. Their rifling consisted of
6 or 8 grooves. These were equally spaced and completed at least
three-quarters of a turn in the length of the barrel.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="489" />
<p class="pcap"><i>These views of the Ferguson rifle show the unique features of its breech
mechanism.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The earliest use of the Ferguson rifle was on American soil by riflemen
whom Major Ferguson had personally trained. It was used at
the Battle of Brandywine and is said to have been used later, with
possibly a few having been in action at Kings Mountain. The successful
use of this rifle in battle is sufficient proof that its inventor had
made a notable contribution to military technology and developed a
most effective arm. Unfortunately, it was at least 90 years ahead of
its time.</p>
<p>What happened to these Ferguson rifles continues to be a matter of
conjecture. While Ferguson convalesced after the Battle of Brandywine,
his rifle corps was disbanded and his rifles put in storage by
Sir William Howe. Later, an undetermined number were withdrawn
from storage for further service. Though it can be assumed a number
were destroyed in action and others carried off for use as new hunting
rifles, a large number still remain unaccounted for.</p>
<p>Today there are only a few known specimens of this arm. Although
those still in existence are largely in private ownership, there
are several on public display in America. Two such arms are in
the National Museum in Washington, one of which was originally
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
given by Ferguson to Frederick de Peyster, the most important example
in this country. The Rudolph J. Nunnemacher Arms Collection
at Milwaukee, Wis., also has one of these weapons, as does the
museum at the United States Military Academy, West Point, N. Y.</p>
<p>The National Park Service is fortunate in owning two Ferguson
rifles. One of these, perhaps the second most important example in
the United States, is in the museum at Morristown National Historical
Park, Morristown, N. J. It is marked with the initials P. F., indicating
it was very probably inspected personally by Patrick Ferguson. The
other is in the Kings Mountain National Military Park Museum.
Though one occasionally hears of a Ferguson rifle for sale, their
acquisition is a collector&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>Your Guide to the Area</i></span></h2>
<p>The battlefield ridge is the most outstanding feature of the park.
Beginning at the Administration and Museum Building, numbered
markers have been placed at the principal points of interest along the
trail. These markers correspond with the numbered paragraphs
below and with the numbers on the guide map. For the best story
on the ground, it is suggested that you follow them in the order given.</p>
<h3>1. THE ADMINISTRATION AND MUSEUM BUILDING.</h3>
<p>Before you set out on
the self-guiding, walking tour of the battlefield ridge, you will enjoy
a visit to the park museum in this building. Colorful displays and
exhibits explain simply and clearly the causes and results of the Battle
of Kings Mountain and the turn of events that followed it in the
Southern Campaign of the American Revolution. A series of exhibits
trace the origin of the mountain men, tell the story of their uprising,
and show their route of march to Kings Mountain. Other displays
explain the progress of the British invasion of the South and the
movement of Ferguson&rsquo;s corps before the battle.</p>
<p>Among the featured exhibits are the battlefield diorama, typical
arms of the mountain men, an electric map showing routes of the
forces engaged in the battle, and examples of the Kentucky and
Ferguson rifles. The diorama is a three-dimensional reenactment in
miniature of a typical Kings Mountain battle scene. The original
Ferguson rifle came from Scotland and is one of the park&rsquo;s prized
possessions.</p>
<h3>2. THE FIRST SHOT.</h3>
<p>Close to this location Tory soldiers fired upon the
advancing frontiersmen. This was the first warning to Ferguson
that he was about to be engaged in battle. Shortly before, other
patriot units passed here toward assigned positions on the southwest
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
and southeast slopes of the ridge. They followed an Indian trail
closely paralleled by the route of the main park drive.</p>
<h3>3. THE BATTLE BEGINS.</h3>
<p>The first shot of the battle was the signal for
all the patriot units that were in position around the base of the ridge
to commence their attack. Here Sevier and Campbell merged their
forces as they engaged Ferguson&rsquo;s Provincial troops in bitter hand-to-hand
fighting. They gained ground, only to lose it again, as they
were repulsed by repeated bayonet charges. But by their heroic action
near this spot, patriot troops on the northeast end of the ridge were
enabled to complete the encirclement of Ferguson&rsquo;s position.</p>
<h3>4. HIGHEST PEAK OF THE BATTLE RIDGE.</h3>
<p>This spot marks the southwestern
end of Ferguson&rsquo;s battle position, which extended the entire
length of the ridge. The Centennial Monument erected in 1880 to
commemorate the American patriots who defeated Ferguson is also
located at this point. It is placed upon ground that was overrun by
the men of Shelby, Sevier, and Campbell who, by their gallantry,
forced Ferguson&rsquo;s troops to retire toward the British campsite.</p>
<h3>5. PATRIOT ADVANCE CONTINUES.</h3>
<p>Bitterly fighting all the while, Tory
forces were gradually pushed back along the top of the ridge in this
area. Here Ferguson had hoped to establish a position from which he
could better withstand the relentless attack of the mountain men.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h3>6. SITE OF THE SURRENDER.</h3>
<p>After constant attack from all sides for
nearly an hour, Ferguson&rsquo;s troops were forced into the clearing at this
point which has changed little since 1780. At this time Ferguson was
killed and the command passed to Capt. Abraham de Peyster, who
very shortly realized that further resistance was useless and in this
area surrendered the remaining Tory troops.</p>
<p>The impressive monument or obelisk at this location was erected in
1909 by the United States Government to memorialize the significant
American victory at Kings Mountain.</p>
<h3>7. TRADITIONAL SPOT WHERE FERGUSON WAS WOUNDED.</h3>
<p>Near this spot
and in the late stages of the engagement, Ferguson, riddled with at
least eight balls, fell from his white charger. One battle account
states that one of these balls was fired by Robert Young, who is reported
to have said in referring to his rifle, as he took aim and fired
at Ferguson: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and see what Sweet-Lips can do.&rdquo; The small
marker stands where the British commander is believed to have been
mortally wounded.</p>

</div>
<h3>8. FERGUSON&rsquo;S GRAVE.</h3>
<p>This was first marked by the granite block to
the northeast of the pile of stones. The tablet on the opposite side
was dedicated October 7, 1930, by President Hoover on the occasion of
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
the Sesquicentennial Celebration. The rock pile originates from
the Scottish tradition of placing a cairn over the grave of a fallen
Chieftain.</p>
<h3>9. THE CHRONICLE MARKERS.</h3>
<p>On July 4, 1815, Dr. William McLean
visited the battlefield and dedicated the gray soft stone on your left.
It stands at the grave of his friend, Maj. William Chronicle, who is
buried here with Capt. John Mattocks, William Rabb, and John Boyd.
It is one of the oldest battlefield markers in the country. One hundred
years later, in 1914, the Kings Mountain Association of Yorkville
(now York), S. C., erected the newer marker to preserve the time-and-weather-worn
inscription on the original.</p>
<h3>10. SPRING.</h3>
<p>One of the principal advantages of Ferguson&rsquo;s campsite
was its water supply which continues to originate from several sources.
This is one of two springs to which the wounded of both sides
are believed to have made their way for water. About 200 yards
ahead, where the trail makes a hairpin turn to the right, you will pass
a second spring on your left which was probably also used during the
battle.</p>
<h3>11. POSITIONS OF SHELBY AND SEVIER.</h3>
<p>As you move up the trail to the
upper parking area, you pass through the lines of Shelby and Sevier,
coorganizers of the patriot march to Kings Mountain. Along the way
are points where they began their attacks which were timed with the
movements of Campbell&rsquo;s men on the opposite slope of the ridge.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><i>Establishment of the Park</i></span></h2>
<p>Kings Mountain National Military Park was established by act of
Congress on March 3, 1931. This was the climax of years of effort by
individuals and patriotic organizations to win national recognition
for the area.</p>
<p>A series of dedicatory celebrations had previously focused public
attention upon it. The first of these celebrations, in 1815, was primarily
local in nature. It did, however, mark the date when the first memorial
stone was placed on the battlefield. This was in memory of
Major Chronicle and three other South Fork boys, who were buried
in a common grave. It was also the forerunner of the more elaborate
celebrations held in 1855, 1880, 1909, and 1930. Despite inadequate
means of travel and few access roads, they were all well attended.</p>
<p>The centennial observance of 1880 is of particular interest. To
insure a successful celebration, the Kings Mountain Centennial Association
was formed in 1879, composed largely of men from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
towns of Kings Mountain and York. These citizens sponsored the
purchase of 40 acres of the battleground and the erection of an appropriate
monument. Generous contributions were received from individuals
and the State Legislatures of North and South Carolina,
resulting in the acquisition of most of the battlefield ridge and the
construction of the Centennial Monument.</p>
<p>Soon after the celebration, the Kings Mountain Centennial Association
was disbanded. Ownership of the battleground was transferred
to the Kings Mountain Chapter of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, with headquarters in York, S. C. These patriotic ladies
used their influence to win the support of the Congress of the United
States for the idea of establishing a national historical shrine at the
battleground. They were encouraged also by increased public support
for their project. When the Congress appropriated $30,000 on
June 16, 1906, for the erection of a new monument, the reaching of
their goal was not too far away. The monument was completed in
time for the celebration of 1909 and was dedicated before dignitaries
from Tennessee, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. It is an 83-foot
obelisk of white marble and stands as a symbol of the recognition by
the Federal Government of the significance of the Battle of Kings
Mountain.</p>

<p>The celebration of October 7, 1930, provided the final impetus to
the movement for the establishment of a national military park at
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
Kings Mountain. One year ahead of the celebration, President Hoover
was invited to be the guest of honor. His address at the celebration
was heard by an estimated 80,000 people and wide press coverage of
the speech brought nationwide attention to Kings Mountain. His
presence also gave the prestige of his office to the long-standing proposal
that the area was deserving of greater national recognition.</p>
<p>Although Kings Mountain National Military Park was finally
established 151 years after the battle it commemorates, the Federal
Government did not at first own any of the land included in the park.
In 1933, responsibility for the development of the site was transferred
by Presidential executive order from the War Department to the
National Park Service of the Department of the Interior.</p>
<p>On September 24, 1935, the Kings Mountain chapter of the
Daughters of the American Revolution, located in York, S. C., donated
the 40 acres of the battleground to which the chapter held title. This
was the nucleus of the park, and additional lands acquired between
1936 and 1940 raised the total holdings within the area to the present
4,012 acres.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><i>How to Reach the Park</i></span></h2>
<p>The park is best approached over North Carolina Route 216 from
U. S. 29, which is 4 miles to the north, and is equidistant from
Charlotte, N. C., and Spartanburg, S. C. It is also accessible over
South Carolina Route 161 from York, S. C.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><i>About Your Visit</i></span></h2>
<p>You may obtain further information about this and other areas of the
National Park System at the Administration and Museum Building
near the main parking area. With the exception of Christmas and
New Year&rsquo;s Day, this building is open daily, with museum hours from
8:30 a. m. to 5 p. m. on weekdays and from 9:30 a. m. to 6 p. m. on
Sundays. Park personnel is available at this building to assist individuals
and organized groups of visitors. To assure such assistance
to large groups, it is advisable that arrangements be made in advance
with the superintendent of the park.</p>
<p>A beautiful amphitheater is situated a short distance east of the
battlefield ridge, near the main park road. An outdoor historical
drama on the Battle of Kings Mountain has been presented here in
late summer during recent years. Adjoining the park on the east
is Kings Mountain State Park where you may picnic and swim in

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
